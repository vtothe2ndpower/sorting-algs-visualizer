# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
The purpose of this application is to create a visualization of how 6 popular sorting algorithms sort an array of random numbers. Each number within the array will be represented by a column of matching height. Additionally, we want to better understand what sorting algorithm is best to use depending on the data we are presented with.
